Theremid
====================

My entry to Music Hack Day London 2014...

Made over 24 hours between the 12th and 13th December 2014.

Working code but not completely finished due to time being up.

Connect your leap motion, fire up [Theremid](http://designerzen.github.io/Leap-Motion-Theremin/)

If you don't have a leap motion - you can use your mouse to control the theremin.

** You will need a modern high-spec browser such as Google Chrome that supports WebGL **

## Forking ##

Then [fork off](https://github.com/designerzen/Leap-Motion-Theremin.git)

## Building ##

* Install NodeJS
* cd into cloned directory
* npm install

Then run either :

* gulp (builds all files to build/ ready for deployment)

or

* gulp test (opens up a local webserver for development)
