Theremid
====================

My entry to Music Hack Day London 2014...

Made over 24 hours between the 12th and 13th December 2014.

Working code but not completely finished due to time being up.

Connect your leap motion, fire up [Theremid](http://awesomething.co.uk/theremid/)

** You will need a modern high-spec browser such as Google Chrome **
